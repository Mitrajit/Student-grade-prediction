# Student-grade-prediction
Linear regression algorithm is used to create a model and predict their final grade. Student perfomance dataset from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) is used to train and test on 90% and 10% data respectively. The model with highest accuracy is saved as studentmodel.pickle . A scatter graph is plotted using pyplot to monitor the accuracy of the prediction.
